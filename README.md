## Local Development

#### Postgres must be installed and running! Local dev. environment uses Postgresql, not SQLite.

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Run `rake db:create && bundle install && rake db:migrate` in the root directory of the project
3. cd into the `client` folder and run `yarn install`
3. Run `rails -s -p 3001` in the root directory of the project
4. cd into the `client` folder and run `yarn start`
5. Optionally you can start both servers by running `bin/rake start` in the root directory. Start each individually if you wish to debug with `binding.pry` in a Rails controller.

The node server will be running on port 3000 and the Rails server will be on port 3001. A proxy is setup in `client/package.json` to proxy our API calls to the Rails server. When the project is deployed to Heroku a Rails server will manage the front end and back end (Rails serves a Webpack bundle).
